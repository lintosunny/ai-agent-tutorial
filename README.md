# AI Agents Tutorial
## AI Agents
Agents are systems that independently accomplish tasks. While conventional software enables users to streamline and automate workflows, agents are able to perform the same workflows on the usersâ€™ behalf with a high degree of independence.

Through agency, AI applications can be classified in two broad categories;
* **Workflow**: Build using LLM, but no agency.
* **AI Agents**: LLMs along with tools, knowledge, and memory with some level of agency.

>*Agency in AI is the ability of any AI system to detect it's environment, access tools, and perform independent actions.*
